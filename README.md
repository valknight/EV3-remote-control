## ev3-remote-control-server

This project is to provide a server side application for controls and interaction with EV3 robots or other similar robot. It is designed to be mobile friendly, and easy to use for remote and in person education sessions.

## ev3-brick-controller

This project is designed as a template for the code running on a LEGO EV3 brick that is designed to interact with ev3-remote-control-server. 

# Basic Setup

Once cloned, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` - this will clone both of the submodules.

Each project will have it's own information on setup and requirements in their READMEs. You can either click on them in GitHub to navigate to the exact repo where the requirements and setup info will be shown, or open up the README once you've synced the submodules.
